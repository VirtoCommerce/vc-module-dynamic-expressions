# Overview

VirtoCommerce.DynamicExpressions module enables building complex dynamic expressions while using user-friendly management UI. Includes expressions for marketing (promotions and content publishing) and pricing dynamic condition builders.

Sometimes there is a need to give an end-user a way of composing conditions under which target objects should be filtered and returned to the client. For example, "the product should be available to the shopper only if he is more than 25 years old". Simplifying condition expressions building for the end-user is often a challenge.

The most common way to build condition expressions is by using a visual UI. That way the user builds the condition expression as a regular sentence. While reading a regular sentence it is easy to understand the specific circumstances the result will yield: object returned. 

## Key features:

* Extendible expression list;
* Create and use custom expressions from your own module.
